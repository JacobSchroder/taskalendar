# Taskalendar

### Take back control of your time.

## Feature ideas:

- Each "day box" in the month calendar view has a "timeline" of the scheduled tasks (in "pill" form) that day (hover to see details)
- From all 3 views you can quicly access a specific task to see/edit details, start timetracking, etc.
- "non-fixed" Recurring tasks: Add task option to be prompted about next occurence when the previous one is completed.
- task priority and status
- task dependencies
- task tags/group
- task notes
- task time tracking
- task motivation - how motivated are you to do this task?
- stress levels - indicate stressfull days / suggest rescheduling tasks (based on motivaiton, task overload etc.)
- auto scheduling of tasks based on dependencies, priority, task motivation and available time
